## Usage

### Examples:
The basic syntax for a command includes the cipher to be used, the text to be used, and whether to encrypt or decrypt the text. Here is an example command:
```shell
ucyph -c 47 -s 'Hello World' -E
```

This command calls the ```rot47``` cipher via the ```-c``` flag and **encrypts** the text via the ```-E``` flag.
