## Setup
Coming soon (hopefully).

## Usage
### Examples:
The basic setup for a command includes the cipher to be used, the text to be used, and whether to encrypt or decrypt the text. Here is an example command:
```shell
ucyph rot47 'Hello World' -e
```

This command calls the ```rot47``` cipher and **encrypts** the text as denoted by the ```-e``` flag.
